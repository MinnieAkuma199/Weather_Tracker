## Description

- Users need to know what the weather will be like for the next 5 days. I created a weather app that once a user searches a city, a 5 day forecast is received. The app displays temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

- I utilized a 3rd party library called Bootstrap as well as jQuery to finish this app. I learned how to call APIs and how to dynamically use the information that I need to display on the app.
