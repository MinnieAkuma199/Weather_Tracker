## Purpose

To create a weather app that once a user searches a city, the user then can see temperature, humidity, and wind speed displayed for both the current day's weather and a 5 day forecast.

## What I learned

I utilized a 3rd party library called Bootstrap as well as jQuery to finish this app. I learned how to call APIs and how to dynamically use the information that I need to display on the app.
